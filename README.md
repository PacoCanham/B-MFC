# B-MFC
Project to assist in role as BMFC, with sbc/soc
dont know what language this will be in or when i will start it, probably JS (once i learn that) will heavily rely on other mapping tools such as geodesy.

## potential features
get grid
input tgt grid
calculate distance, range, bearing.
add corretions A/D L/R as well as Polar.

## unlikely features
use LoRa / mesh to see other people/positions.


## things to avoid!
overlapping atak/just making a bad version without mapping.

ideally make deployable with gps and small keypad on pi zero 1inch screen
18650 battery, to make light and long lasting. else it's pointless
